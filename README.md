# OpinionMiner

With the emergence of social media, internet is filled with mass data and this
data has a meaning. People are willingly contributing this big data pool every day
by writing their opinions and uploading their own media. We can actually consider
internet as a brain which has limitless information flowing through it. But every brain
has its own method to evaluate the data that it consists.
This projectâ€™s aim is to contribute the evaluation of this big data by creating a
web application for extracting the data from the social media and calculate the opinions
of the social media users. Thanks to Twitter API, we have a way to extract these data
and calculate the opinions of the social media user by using natural language processing
methods.
